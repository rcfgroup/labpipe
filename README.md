# LabPipe

LabPipe is a toolkit that was created to streamline data handling, by supporting semi-automated vendor software data collection, linkage and transfer; collection/data entry of biomedical meta-data linked to data/samples; and optionally sample collection notifications.

It consists of two components, LabPipe Client (LPC) and LabPipe Server (LPS). Information on setting up these components is provided on their individual GitHub repositories:

* [**LPC**](https://github.com/rcfgroup/labpipe-client-public)
* [**LPserver**](https://github.com/rcfgroup/labpipe-server-public)
 
Both the LPclient and LPserver tools are available to download under the GNU General Public License (GPL-3.0).

A guide to getting started using LabPipe can be found at [docs.labpipe.org](https://docs.labpipe.org/)

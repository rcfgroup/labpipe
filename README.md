# LabPipe

LabPipe is a tool that was created to streamline data handling, by supporting semi-automated sample data collection, linkage and transfer; collection/data entry of biomedical meta-data linked to the samples; and sample collection notifications.

It consists of two components, LPclient and LPserver. Information on setting up these components is provided on their individual GitHub repositories:

* [**LPclient**](https://github.com/rcfgroup/labpipe-client-public)
* [**LPserver**](https://github.com/rcfgroup/labpipe-server-public)
 
Both the LPclient and LPserver tools are available to download under a non-commercial open-source licence (NPOSL 3.0).
